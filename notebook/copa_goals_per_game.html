            ## ~~Is Copa America 2016 goal draught historical?~~
            
            I started writing this after Mexico's win over Uruguay was the only game to have more than 2 goals, and the goals per game average sat at 1.33 after 6 games.
            
            Well... It's up to 2.0 GPG after 9.5 games and Colombia still might drop a few more on Paraguay as a type this.
            
            Anyway, I'll keep updating this through the group stage. Might be interesting to see how this tournament stacks up to other recent tournaments involving CONCACAF and CONMEBOL men's senior teams.
